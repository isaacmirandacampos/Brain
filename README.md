# Brain
The vault used to store my notes and thoughts. The tool I use to manage these notes is https://obsidian.md

## The intention
I will put here important notes around my learning. It will be a tool to store my memories and help remember things.

## How it works?
I will use _Zettelkasten_ method to create the notes.

Making them public is a way to reveal more about me without formalising. Maybe some content is wrong or out of date and I need to improve it, and that's okay for me. I have chosen this method to my learning, and it will be the process to create something magic.

## Consideration
Not necessary i will add all content that i'm studying, it's only the content that i think important considering the context or the content.
